title:  "Explaining Coding to my Friends"

  As a former personal trainer attempting to make a transition to a career in the tech industry, I have many friends that work in different fields (mostly non-technical) that do not really understand what coding/programming is other than the fact that the people who do it "make programs".
	
	
  When trying to better explain what coding is to my friends, I use the metaphor of the construction of a building. It's no coincidence that we are sometimes referred to as software architects. Although it may not be the absolute perfect metaphor, the process of constructing a building shares many aspects with the process of constructing a program. For the purpose of better explaining the concept of programming to non-programmers, it does the job well.

	
	When constructing a building: 
	

* 	The building must be built in a way that it obeys certain rules and laws of physics for the building to stand properly (similar to how the code contained in a program must abide by the syntax of the programming language used in order to work).
* 	Before any construction begins, a detailed blueprint must be made (similar to how you should write your code out in pseudocode before you start writing the actualy code).
* 	The building must be built to the exact specifications outlined in the blueprint or else it will not come out as intended. (similar to how the code in a program must be as detailed and account for as many possibilities as possible in order for the program to work as intended).

  The role techonology plays in our lives is increasing every day. I feel lucky to have found the Learn-Verified program as I feel it will be more and more important as time goes on to understand how to code.
