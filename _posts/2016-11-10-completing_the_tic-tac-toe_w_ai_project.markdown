As I type this blog post, I am putting the final touches on my Tic-Tac-toe w/ AI project. It took a while for me to complete this project, but not because it was impossibly hard, but because I've found it difficult to concentrate again due to the pandemonium of the election (thank god that's finally over). That is not to say that there were significant challenges to be overcome with this project.

The easiest parts of this project to code were the board.rb and the game.rb files. Since we all previously built an OO Tic-Tac-Toe project as part of our application to the Learn-Verified program, I was able to take most of the methods from that project and apply them to this one with a little fine tuning.

The hardest (but most fulfilling) part of this project to code in my opinion would be the computer (AI) player class. It was a great feeling to see two computer players create a game I created, through the code I wrote. Now, onto the Student Scraper project.
