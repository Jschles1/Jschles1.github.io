If you've been wondering why I haven't made a blog post in a while, it's because I received a job offer for a developer internship position and haven't had much time at all to research topics and write blog posts. Three weeks on the job, it has been an exhausting, yet rewarding experience. I have been greatly pushed out of my comfort zone and have learned a lot. 

In an effort to get back into the habit of making blog posts, I will write a very short blog post detailing some CSS tricks I learned from working with more senior developers at my job.

## Keep a Ruler By Your Computer

This is one of those tips that make you wonder why you never thought of it before. This is especially useful when you need to get your styles look a certain exact way, such as when you need to get a webpage to look exactly like a mockup provided by a designer. You're expected to get it down right to the exact pixel when working as a professional developer, so having a ruler to compare your webpage to the design is invaluable.

## Recreate Real-World Websites

Recreating popular websites is one of the best ways to practice and improve your CSS skills. If you get stuck, you can always use the developer tools to take a look at how a certain style is being implemented. Of course, only focus on recreating the styles, not the functionality of the whole site. It's a lot less frustrating to build a mockup of the Facebook's homepage than it is to try it's recreate the entire codebase, which includes [30,000 React components](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9463#issuecomment-295643228).

## Bookmark w3schools.com

You might be laughing, but it cannot be understated how valuable of a resource this website is. It's almost like a wikipedia for not only CSS, but HTML and JavaScript as well. If you're unsure about how a certain selector works for example, you can just look it up and read more about it.

In the coming weeks, I may not have time to post every week, but I will do my best to update this blog in lieu of the demands of my new position. If you have any suggestions for future blog posts to write, feel free to let me know.
