Hello World!
```

  Hi, Iâ€™m John, a recent college graduate with BS in Business/Marketing, lifelong video game player, certified personal trainer and technology enthusiast. 

  In childhood, I had some unusual abilities: photographic memory, early reading and ability to hyperfocus and solve puzzles, so my parents had my IQ tested for giftedness. My scores were high in mathematical and fluid reasoning, pattern recognition, but were superior in the Block Design test, a measure of visual-spatial intelligence. I was always drawn to the computer when my peers were playing sports. I was proficient in playing musical instruments, but becoming the best video gamer was my passion. I went to tech summer camps learning game design and modding. 
    
  In college, I developed another passion: bodybuilding and physical fitness. By persevering 2 hours a day in the gym and improving my diet, I increased my strength and muscle mass and completely transformed my old physique into one I never thought I would be able to achieve before. Upon graduation from college, I decided to become certified as a personal trainer and turn my passion into a career. 
    
  Unfortunately, after only a few months in the profession, I decided that it ultimately wasnt for me. I found that being a successful personal trainer relied more on being a good salesman than being good at the actual training aspect of it. As someone who is more introverted, being under the constant pressure from my employer of making sales was something I severely disliked (especially as a new trainer, which at most gyms get paid close to minimum wage to start). I wanted a career where my talents would let me shine instead of constantly being under pressure to make a sale.
    
  I began work at a marketing internship with no idea what direction I really wanted to take in life. In my search for a direction, I found Codecademy.com. I was always somewhat intrigued by having a career in the tech field, but I dismissed that possibility in college, opting to take the path toward a fitness career instead. I also found through research that many people with exceptional visual-spatial skills usually made good programmers. Codecademy gave me a better concept of what coding actually was, but the way they taught the material made it hard to retain concepts, and it didn't really didn't show me what a software developer actually did.
    
  I then got a paid subscription to teamtreehouse.com. While this website made everything a little easier to understand, it still wasn't clicking with me. I was ready to give up on this career path until I found the Flatiron School. What really stood out to me about this program was that it really illustrated what it was like to be a software engineer. With newfound inspiration, I quickly and almost effortlessly worked through the intro to ruby course as fast as I could. After finishing, I applied to the Learn-Verified program and was accepted.
    
  It has been close to month since I started, I have already learned so much. With my upcoming blog posts, I look forward to contributing valuable content as I chronicle my journey into the tech world.
