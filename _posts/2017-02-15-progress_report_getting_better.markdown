  Having just submitted my Sinatra Fwitter project, I'm now sitting here looking through Learn Magazine trying to get ideas for my Sinatra portfolio project by seeing examples of what other students have done. Then it occurred to me that I haven't written a blog post myself since my completion of my CLI Data Gem project, so I'll take this chance to post a short update on my progress.

  So, the good news is I'm feeling confident and happy about my progress this new year so far. I managed to make through the SQL, ActiveRecord, Rack and Sinatra units without much difficulty at all. The Learn Instructors were invaluable when it came to the times I got stuck on any of the labs. I had to laugh at myself in an instance where I spent a few hours trying to figure out why a certain test on one of the Sinatra labs wasn't passing, as I was certain I had the right code. I gave in and had Learn Instructor Dakota do a screenshare with me to figure out the problem. Within a few minutes he realized that the problem was that I forgot to type the `/` in one of my `get` controller routes! I guess the moral of the story is that it's sometimes better to get another set of eyes to look at your code when you're having a problem, as they can catch things you might have looked over.

  One thing I intend to focus on after I finish my Sinatra project is to use the pair programming feature more often. I initially intended to pair up for the Fwitter project, but my schedule became hectic the last week and a half and I didn't really get any time to code that much. Eventually it came to the point where I felt like I was falling behind a little bit. I had also thought about the lab and envisioned what the code would look like, so I decided to just get the project out the way and do it myself. I managed to complete the whole project in one night. I guess having a good photographic memory has its benefits in programming.
