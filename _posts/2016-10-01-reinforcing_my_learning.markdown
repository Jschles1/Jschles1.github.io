For the past week, I have spent the majority of my time on Learn retracing my steps and redoing many of the recent labs I have done. I had just reached the Music Library CLI Final Project Lab and felt that I was not comfortable with the concepts presented in the Object Oriented Ruby course as I should have been. Perhaps I was going through a slight case of impostor syndrome?

One of the main mistakes I feel I have made is going through each lesson and lab too quickly. I was more focused on passing lab tests as quickly as possible to get to the next lesson instead of truly understanding each concept completely. Fortunately, I have found that going through a lot of the Object Oriented Ruby labs a second time has helped me out immensely. Concepts that I understood only somewhat are now much more clear upon reading them over again several times.

What this whole experience has taught me is when it comes to programming, you can't just read about these concepts once and expect them to just stick with you. You have to revisit them time and time again to reinforce your knowledge of them. Treat programming as a skill that should practiced frequently.
