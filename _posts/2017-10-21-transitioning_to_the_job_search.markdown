After graduating, one would think that I would have more time, but its actually the opposite. With graduation, I now have to juggle my time between the following:

- My obligations to the career services: finalizing my resume, preparing for my mock interviews, and maintaining my online presence. My initial career coach took another position elsewhere and I wasn’t able to really get the ball rolling in regards to the career services provided by Flatiron until I was about to start working on my React project. As a result, I’ve had to cram it all in the past two weeks with my new coach. After all this preliminary work is done, the networking process will go into full effect as well.
- Revisiting the material from early in the curriculum, since working on JavaScript and React the past few months has made me rusty on those subjects. So far I’ve revisited HTML/CSS and some procedural Ruby. I’m mainly focusing on JavaScript as a whole right now for my upcoming mock technical interview.
- Learning new material, mainly related to CS and algorithm topics. I feel that this is definitely my weak point right now as a developer. I’m going to make this my main focus of where I spend my time once I finish refreshing my knowledge on the early sections of the curriculum. Here are the sources I’m planning on utilizing:
    - The Flatiron CS module.
    - [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)
    - [Base CS](https://medium.com/basecs)
    - [Learning Algorithms from JavaScript in Scratch on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/)
    - Pretty much anything else of value I can find (blog posts, articles, youtube videos, etc.)
    - Sites like code wars and hacker rank which I have already been utilizing to test my skills.
    - If you're reading this blog and have any other suggestions for me to add to this list, reach out and let me know!
- Improving my portfolio projects and making git commits. It is an interesting experience to see how much I have grown as a developer when I went back to my earliest project, the CLI gem, and almost immediately saw several bad uses of code that made me cringe. For example, I saw that there was an instance where I was using several elsif statements when I could have easily used a case statement. I’m also adding additional features to my projects. For example, since I made my Bestselling Games CLI gem, Nintendo released their newest system, the Switch. I have went back and added functionality to the gem so users can request the bestselling games of that system.

Juggling all of these tasks is really teaching me the importance of time management. So far, I think I'm doing a pretty good job of that. Any stress brought on by having to attend to all these tasks is nothing compared to the excitement I feel looking towards the future, where a new career opportunity as a developer awaits me. Until I get there however, I'm going to keep pushing forward.
