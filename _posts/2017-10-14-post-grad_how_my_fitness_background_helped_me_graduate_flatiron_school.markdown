After passing my assessment for the React-Redux final project, I have finally graduated from the Flatiron School’s Learn-Verified curriculum. It may have taken me longer than most, but  I’m finally here.

When I made my first blog post a little over a year ago, I explained that I planned on having a career in the fitness industry as a personal trainer. While attending college, I discovered a passion for bodybuilding and physical fitness. By persevering 2 hours a day in the gym and improving my diet, I increased my strength and muscle mass and completely transformed my old physique into one I never thought I would be able to achieve before. This was an especially huge accomplishment for me as I was never an athletic person during my teenage years, preferring activities such as video games. It made such a huge impact on my life that I decided to pursue a career in personal training. I then spent a few months getting certified.

Unfortunately, after a few weeks of working in that field, I quickly decided that it was not for me. There was much more pressure put on selling training packages instead of implementing the creative aspect of creating training programs for clients. I wanted to work in a field where my creative aspect could shine.

When I signed up for the Learn-Verified program, I realized that I would be making another transformation; instead this time, I would be making a mental transformation instead of physical; I would be learning to look at things in new ways that I didn’t know I would be capable of before.

In this blog post, I will explain different things I learned that helped me make a successful fitness transformation during my fitness journey, and how I applied those principles while learning how to code. If you're a newly enrolled student, I hope that this post provides you value.

The first and most important piece of advice I would give is that **consistency is key.** In the fitness industry, one of the most infamous gym-goer stereotypes one can fit into is the new years resolutioner. These people resolve to change their ways and get into shape by joining a gym at the beginning of the new year. Unfortunately, after about a few weeks many of them give up on their goals when they don't see the results they expected. While many newbies expect to make radical changes in how they look after only a few workouts, the reality is that in most cases, it will take atleast a few months to see any major noticeable differences. For me personally, it took me around **2 years** to go from having almost no muscle at all to attaining the physique I have today. Not only that, you must workout on a consistent basis. You can't work out for a few days then take a week or two off and expect to get good results. You have to incorporate it into your lifestyle.

Going through the Learn-Verfied program, there early instances where I would get extremely frustrated at a lab and take a day or two off at a time. When I returned, I would find that it was difficult to get into that coding mindset again, having to refresh myself on things I had just learned. Then, I started to look at coding each day like a mental workout that I had to hold myself accountable for. It didn't matter if it ended up only being around 20 minutes one day, the important part was that I showed up and did something everyday. This simple change greatly sped up my progress through the curriculum. A popular phrase used to encapsulate this concept is **ABC: Always Be Coding.** In both fitness and programming, you won't see improvements from day to day, but you will definitely see them over time if you put the work in.

The second piece of advice I would give is to **plan how to tackle a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces.** I started to see results from exercising when I made a detailed workout plan describing which exercises I would do on a given day. Each day was for a different muscle group: chest, arms, legs, etc. There are many people at my gym who go on a consistent basis, but they still don't see results because they workout whatever they feel like at the moment and don't have a specific plan of what they want to accomplish. This causes them to not be focused entirely on their workout, and they usually end up spending too much time socializing or playing with their phone.

You can use a similar strategy while coding. With my workouts, I planned them out by breaking them down into smaller pieces (exercises) that I would be able to focus on one at a time without being overwhelmed by the big picture. I did the same for my labs and projects, where I would break down what I would try to accomplish in pseudocode steps. This allowed me to focus on one problem at a time instead of trying to think about how to solve all the problems presented by the lab/project at once.

The last piece of advice I would give is to **not be afraid to ask for help.** When it comes to fitness, ask for a spot from your fellow gym-goer if you need help getting a heavy weight up for an exercise. If you’re totally lost on what to do in the gym or where to start, hire a personal trainer. 

If you’re stuck on a lab, don’t be afraid to use the Ask A Question feature. I knew sometimes during my run through the curriculum that my ego would get in the way, and that part of me felt like using the feature was me “giving up”.  I realized this was a waste of time when I couldn’t get a certain lab to pass in the Sinatra portion after trying for about 4 hours to fix a bug. Stumped, I utilized the Ask A Question feature. The learn expert immediately noticed I was missing a '/' character at the beginning of one of my urls, fixing the problem. Sometimes all it takes is another pair of eyes to catch a bug you've been struggling to find.

While I have just graduated the Learn-Verified program, I know that my journey as a developer is only just getting started. Stay tuned for future blog posts, where I will be documenting each step of this journey and the things I learn from it.
