I have just completed my most challenging lab to date, the Music CLI final project. As I mentioned in my last blog post, I was feeling overwhelmed and stuck after my first attempt at completing this project. I then went and backtracked through many of the OO Ruby lessons to brush up on my knowledge and skills. It proved to be a good decision on my part.

This project really started to click for me when I studied the lessons on object relationships more closely. I believe that a good knowledge of object relationships is the most important thing to have when completing this project. Being able to implement the has many, belongs to, and has many through relationships more effectively between the Genre, Artist, and Song classes was what made completing this project possible.

Even though I had some difficulty in completing this lab, I'm proud of myself of sticking with it and not giving up, even when it seemed impossible for me at first. I guess that's a valuable habit to have when you're a programmer. Now, onto my next project, the Tic Tac Toe w/ AI assessment.
