I'll be the first to admit that I have not been making as much progress in this program that I wish I have the past few weeks. I have found myself distracted by other things, mainly by the ridiculousness of the current events in our country (with an election cycle that seems to be straight out of an episode of House of Cards), other things going on in my personal life, and just procrastination in and of itself. I'm also at the point in object-oriented ruby where I can't just blaze through lessons and labs without difficulty like I was able to in the earlier sections of the program.

I'm mainly making this blog post for self-accountability reasons and as a way to motivate myself to push through. I know I'm perfectly capable of completing this program, I just have to put in the work necessary. Its time to get back to the grind.

Lets do this!
