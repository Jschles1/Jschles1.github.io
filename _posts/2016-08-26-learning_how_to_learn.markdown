We all know learning how to code is hard. It requires great focus and dedication. Knowing this, I decided to enroll in a course on Coursera called "Learning How to Learn" so I could learn how to learn more efficiently.

I have not gotten that far into the course so far (since my main focus is of course is the Learn Verified program), but I have already found great value in it. Some of these concepts are very helpful when it comes to learning how to code. For example:

When it comes to our brain, we are in one of two thinking modes at all times: either **focused** or **diffused**. You can't be in both at the same time.

Our brains our in a focused state when we are intentionally focusing on something that we are trying to learn or understand. However, focused state thinking relies on familiar and fixed thought patterns.

When it comes to adopting new patterns of thinking or ideas, sometimes being in a focused state of thinking isn't very effective. For this, it is better to be in a diffused state of thinking, which involves looking at things from a broader, big-picture perspective to create new thought patterns.

The way I have used these concepts when learning how to code is that I try to adopt a more diffused mind state when initially learning about a new concept, then switching to a focused state when trying to understand the finer aspects of that concept.

Here's the link to the course if any of you are interested in learning more efficiently.
